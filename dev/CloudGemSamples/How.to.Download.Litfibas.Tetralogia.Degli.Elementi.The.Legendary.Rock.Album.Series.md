If you are wondering why Litfiba chose to base their albums on the four elements, here is some background information. The band was inspired by the concept of the tetralogy, a series of four related works of art or literature, such as Wagner's Ring Cycle or Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. They wanted to create a musical tetralogy that would reflect their artistic vision and express their views on the world.
  
The four elements represent different aspects of life and nature, as well as different musical styles and moods. El Diablo is the album of fire, symbolizing passion, energy, rebellion and conflict. Terremoto is the album of earth, symbolizing stability, tradition, roots and resistance. Spirito is the album of air, symbolizing freedom, creativity, change and spirituality. Mondi Sommersi is the album of water, symbolizing emotion, mystery, depth and exploration.
  
The Tetralogia Degli Elementi is not only a musical project, but also a cultural and social one. The band wanted to use their music as a way to communicate with their fans and the public, to raise awareness and to challenge the status quo. The albums deal with topics such as politics, religion, ecology, identity, love and death. The band also used their music as a tool for activism and solidarity, supporting various causes and movements.
